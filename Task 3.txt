Implementation -
1. Implemnted the Mask R-CNN transfer learning model for the image segmentation.
2. Used the Keras_ocr model for text segmentation 
3. The use of opencv impaint for impainting the images.
4. I found that there are some issues with the Pixellib library and requires some changes(mentioned in the notebook)
5. I have learnt about image segmentation and the various use cases in which it could be implemented.

Alternative -

1. You can use the U-Net model for image segmentation as well.
2. also the pytesseract llibrary can also be used for text segmentation.
3. flask as well as streamlit can be used to create a web application and Heroku or Docker can be used to deploy the model as well.
